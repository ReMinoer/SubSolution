XML format:

- Id as keyref
- Change filter element names
    - Nothing better for now
- Xsd default values
    - Considered as required attribute by LinqToXsd for some reason
- Remove WhereProject/WhereFile ?
    - Still more optimized/direct than Projects.Where/Files.Where

Solution read/write:

- Support some MSBuild variables (like $(SolutionDir))
- Prevent files at root
- Shared Projects & GlobalSection
- RawSolution sections controllers
- Detect project move
    - Identifying is hard (by name + same folder/contexts)
- Detect project rename/move made by program
    - User dictionary ?
- RawSolution versions
    - Get released/local Visual Studio versions ?
- Default GlobalSection SolutionProperties & ExtensibilityGlobals
- Conserve file writing encoding
    - Not that simple. Keep coherence for now.

MSBuild:

- Find Visual Studio MSBuild binaries first by default
- Release alternative build of subsln using .NET Framework for VS MsBuild strong compatibility.

Global API improvements:

- CancellationToken
- Better XSD to C# converter
- Check duplicate GUIDs everywhere

New features:

- GeneratedFrom Global Section
    - To find subsln from sln
    - Reference a rebuild command line as alternative ?
- Specific Project Config-platform support
    - Do not make much sense but might be needed by some users
- ProjectReference fix on project move ?
    - Require project rewriting
- MSBuild SolutionFile converter
    - Lack project type GUID !!

Tests:

- Real unit-test instead of sample tests
- Small project content to test SubSolution.MSBuild

Clean:

- "internal" access
- Remove CovarientDictionary
    - Still required by implementation
